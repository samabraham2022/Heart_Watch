# Heart_Watch

This project addresses the prevailing technological gap within the hospital industry by introducing Heart Watch: an Intelligent Cardiac Monitoring and Diagnosis System. 
Despite global technological progress, hospitals often rely on manual processes. Heart Watch aims to revolutionize these practices by creating a centralized system for 
monitoring and predicting patient conditions. By employing socket programming, data from health monitoring devices like ECG heart rate monitors is collected and stored in a central database. 
Through data analysis, the system predicts potential diseases and emergencies, with results displayed on a portal accessible to nurses. This innovative approach reduces manual interventions 
during critical situations, enhancing patient care. Heart Watch represents a transformative leap toward merging healthcare with technology, facilitating quicker and more accurate medical 
interventions for improved patient outcomes.
